# Evaluating Vehicle Performance - 2022-23 Competition Year

In the competition year 2022-23, our experience underscored the need for a more comprehensive and practical approach to evaluate the performance of vehicles. We realized that relying solely on theoretical considerations was insufficient. To truly assess a vehicle's performance and make necessary improvements, we required dynamic and practical metrics.

## Electric All-Terrain Vehicle (e-ATV)

Our electric all-terrain vehicle (e-ATV) was a major focus of our endeavors, and its electrical system was a key element. This system can be divided into two primary sub-divisions, each playing a vital role in ensuring the vehicle's functionality and efficiency.

### Ground Low Voltage (12V)

The Ground Low Voltage (GLV) component encompasses a network of low-voltage circuits designed to facilitate the startup sequence of our e-ATV. While often operating behind the scenes, these circuits are essential for initiating and maintaining the vehicle's performance.

### High Voltage (48V)

The High Voltage (HV) system serves as the beating heart of our vehicle. It comprises several critical components:

- **In-House Manufactured 48V - 117.6Ah Li-ion Battery:**
  At the core of the HV system is a powerful, in-house manufactured lithium-ion battery pack. This impressive battery stores energy and ensures that our e-ATV has a reliable and long-lasting power source.

- **5KW PMSM Motor:**
  To convert the stored energy into motion, our e-ATV is equipped with a robust 5KW Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). This motor is responsible for delivering the necessary power to propel the vehicle with efficiency and precision.

- **Battery Management System (BMS):**
  The BMS plays a critical role in monitoring the battery's parameters, ensuring its health and safety. It actively manages the state of the battery to optimize its performance and longevity.

- **20A Charger:**
  To keep our vehicle ready for action, we've incorporated a 20A charger that efficiently replenishes the battery's charge, allowing our e-ATV to be quickly prepped for the next adventure.

This comprehensive electrical system, combining the Ground Low Voltage and High Voltage components, is the backbone of our e-ATV's performance. By integrating practical, dynamic metrics and components, we can continuously monitor and enhance the vehicle's capabilities. The 48V Li-ion battery, the powerful PMSM motor, the vigilant BMS, and the efficient charger work together to provide a reliable and robust electric all-terrain vehicle that's ready to tackle any challenge.
